# Netflix-Checker
A python program to check all your netflix accounts and separate the working one's 

Ever somehow you got ton of netfflix accounts they just magically appered or something 
and you want to filter out the ones which are working and which are not 
This selenium script does exactly that 

Next we will see how to use

# USAGE 
1.first we will have to clone the repo using git 
``` git clone https://github.com/AaravAtGit/Netflix-Checker.git```  

2.then we will change the directory ``` cd Netflix-Checker ```  

3.now the main part add a txt file named netflix.txt which includes all the accounts the format should be like this 
`email:pass: | other info is there is any` if you dont have a list of netflix accounts(which most of us have laying around) and you want to try it out then rename example.txt to netflix.txt

4. now selenium will do its work and all your valid accounts will be in a txt file. if for some reason its unable to verify some accounts then they will be in another txt file netflix_unveried.txt

5. Good luck
6. Happy hacking : )
